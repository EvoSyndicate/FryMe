## Is this a todo?

What are some things to consider when designing microprocessors or databases?

I've noticed in nature, that certain things happen exactly at the same time.  A good example is pecans, nuts, or seeds falling.  When I design a database, I wouldn't immediately think it's vital.

I put this plant in a bucket and boiled it and put the boiled version of the plant nearby.

As the plant molded, I heard the seeds dropping from the plant in the bucket nearby and alas, I had that minty green mold.  When I smelled it, it smelled like a combination of a dentist's office and a nail salon, and it seemed to relieve pain-related nausea.

I'm not sure I'm just taking a shot in the dark when I think about microprocessor or database design, but usually, I would think that if epoc time is being used as an index, it would be a one to one, instead of a one to many type relationship.
